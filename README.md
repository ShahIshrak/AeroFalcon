# AERO FALCON 
<sub> AERO-structural optimization for Flight And Lift-Constrained Optimization of Nonlinear twist </sub>
AERO FALCON: A Low-fidelity aero-structural optimization framework for small UAV wings. Combines classical lifting-line theory with ML-based airfoil polars (NeuralFoil), incorporating Reynolds variation, sweep effects, and structural constraints. Optimizes spanwise twist distribution to maximize C_L/C_D ratio for early-stage wing design.
